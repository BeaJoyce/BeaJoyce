#USING LOOP FUNCTION


#1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.

```{r}
vectorA <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

matrix5x5 <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for (i in 1:5) {
  matrix5x5[i, ] <- vectorA
}

print(matrix5x5)

```
